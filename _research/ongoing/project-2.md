## Introduction

Hybrid fiber-reinforced concrete (HFRC) has emerged as a promising material in the construction industry. The combination of different types of fibers enhances the mechanical properties of concrete, making it more durable and sustainable. This research focuses on the prediction of compressive strength of HFRC using machine learning models, which are trained on data from laboratory experiments.

## Objective

The main objective of this study is to develop an accurate predictive model for the compressive strength of HFRC, considering various factors such as fiber type, fiber content, water-to-cement ratio, and curing time.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

Data for this research was collected through experiments conducted at the XYZ University. The dataset includes information on the following factors:

- Fiber Type (e.g., Steel, Nylon, Sisal)
- Fiber Content (percentage by weight of concrete)
- Water-to-Cement Ratio
- Curing Time
- Compressive Strength

### Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning models were applied to predict the compressive strength, including:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- LGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)

The models were evaluated based on performance metrics such as R², Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Findings

### Prediction Accuracy

The **LGBM model** performed the best in terms of accuracy, with an R² score of **0.91**, followed by the Random Forest model with an R² of **0.87**. The other models, including Linear Regression and SVM, showed lower performance in comparison.

### Key Factors

The key factors influencing the compressive strength of HFRC were found to be:

- **Fiber Type**: Steel fibers contributed the most to the strength.
- **Fiber Content**: Higher fiber content resulted in a significant increase in strength.
- **Water-to-Cement Ratio**: Lower ratios led to higher compressive strength.
- **Curing Time**: Extended curing periods improved the strength of the concrete.

## Conclusion

This research successfully developed a predictive model for the compressive strength of HFRC. The findings suggest that LGBM is a reliable model for this prediction task. Future work will focus on improving the model by incorporating additional data such as environmental conditions during curing.
